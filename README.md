# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

A well-structured repository containing Java implementations of essential **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. This repo is part of my learning journey to strengthen problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews at top tech companies.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

### ✅ Data Structures
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly)
- Stacks (using Array & LinkedList)
- Queues (including Circular Queue)
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Traversals)
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- HashMaps & HashSets
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix/List, BFS, DFS)
- Tries
- Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

### ✅ Algorithms
- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort)
- Searching (Linear, Binary Search)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming (Memoization, Tabulation)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sliding Window Technique
- Two Pointers Technique
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Topological Sort, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Strengthen core Java + DSA concepts
- Prepare for coding interviews (LeetCode, GFG, Codeforces, etc.)
- Build reusable templates for contests and placements
- Serve as a quick revision resource

---


Each folder contains well-named Java files with:
- Problem statement (in comments)
- Approach explained (in comments)
- Code with time & space complexity noted

---

## 🛠 Tools & Tech

- Java (JDK 17 or 11)
- IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- JUnit (optional for testing)
- GitHub for version control
